The first lab was the modeling of the system in which we had to make measurements for the system through the oscilloscope that are described in the pdf
The Second lab our goal was to implement a linear controller who would get the motor in a perticular position without oscillations and at a good time response.
In the third lab we constructed a dynamic feedback controller in order to reduce the concequencies of the disturbances and the noise.
Last but not least in the fourth lab we simulated and observer in order to follow the voltage measurments of both velocity and position.This measurments was used to construct a new controller.
In the files you will find the matlab code implemented in the laboratory and simulink files that i used in order to be more prepared.The output of the each simulink simulation justifies the choises that i made inthe lab.
Also at the end you will find a paper report in which i explain theorytically in detail every mathematic equation that is used for the system.Also you will find the block diagram of the system
